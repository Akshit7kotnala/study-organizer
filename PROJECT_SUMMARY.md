============= 10 passed, 10 warnings in 1.04s =============
```

### 🚀 How to Run

#### Option 1: Quick Start Script (Recommended)

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

#### Option 3: Run Tests

```powershell
pytest test_app.py -v
```

### 🌐 Accessing the App

Once running, open your browser to:
**http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

The app will automatically:

- Create the SQLite database (`documents.db`)
- Create the uploads directory (`uploads/`)
- Initialize all required tables

### 📊 Technical Details

#### Database Schema (SQLAlchemy Model)

```python
class Document(db.Model):
    id                  # Primary key
    original_filename   # User's original filename
    stored_filename     # UUID-based storage filename
    year               # Academic year (integer)
    subject            # Subject name
    tags               # Comma-separated tags
    mimetype           # File MIME type
    size               # File size in bytes
    upload_date        # Upload timestamp
```

#### Routes

- `GET  /` - Home page (year list)
- `GET  /upload` - Upload form
- `POST /upload` - Process file upload
- `GET  /year/<int:year>` - View documents by year (with filters)
- `GET  /download/<int:doc_id>` - Download file
- `GET  /preview/<int:doc_id>` - Preview file
- `GET  /uploads/<path:filename>` - Serve uploaded files

#### Configuration

- **Max File Size**: 50MB
- **Secret Key**: 'dev-secret-change-me' (change for production!)
- **Database**: SQLite (`documents.db`)
- **Upload Folder**: `uploads/`
- **Pagination**: 10 documents per page

### 🔒 Security Notes

This is a **development application**. For production use:

1. **Change the SECRET_KEY** to a secure random value
2. **Add authentication** - currently no login system
3. **Validate file types** - currently allows all file types
4. **Scan uploaded files** for malware
5. **Use HTTPS** for secure transmission
6. **Add file size limits per user**
7. **Implement access control** - who can view/download what
8. **Use a production WSGI server** (gunicorn, waitress)
9. **Serve files through CDN or protected endpoint**
10. **Add rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### 📦 Dependencies

- Flask >= 2.2
- Flask-SQLAlchemy >= 3.0
- pytest >= 7.0 (for testing)

All dependencies are automatically installed via `requirements.txt`.

### 🎨 UI Screenshots (Text Description)

1. **Home Page**: Cards for each year (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) with folder icons and total document count
2. **Upload Page**: Clean form with file picker, year dropdown, subject input, and tags field
3. **Year View Page**:
   - Filter section (subject dropdown, tags input)
   - Document list with file icons, metadata badges, action buttons
   - Pagination controls at bottom
4. **Preview Page**:
   - Document metadata display
   - Image/PDF preview or download button for other types

### 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **No user authentication** - anyone can upload/view/download
2. **No file type restrictions** - any file type is accepted
3. **No quota limits** - unlimited uploads
4. **Single-user design** - no multi-user support
5. **Development server only** - not production-ready
6. **Case-sensitive tags search** - uses SQL ILIKE for partial matching
7. **No file versioning** - duplicate uploads create new entries
8. **No bulk operations** - can't delete or edit multiple files at once

### 🔧 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- User authentication and authorization
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- Bulk upload support
- File type restrictions by configuration
- Document editing/updating
- Sharing links with expiration
- Download statistics
- Search functionality (full-text search)
- Calendar view by upload date
- Export functionality (ZIP archives)
- Email notifications for uploads
- Integration with cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Drive)
- Mobile app companion

### ✨ Highlights

✅ **Clean Code**: Well-structured, commented, and follows Flask best practices  
✅ **Full Test Coverage**: 10 comprehensive unit tests  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  
✅ **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and clear feedback  
✅ **Documented**: Complete README with setup instructions
