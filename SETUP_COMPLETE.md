# Google OAuth Authentication Setup Complete! üéâ

## What's Been Done

I've successfully implemented Google OAuth authentication for your Study Organiser app. Here's what's been added:

### 1. **Authentication System**

- ‚úÖ Flask-Login for session management
- ‚úÖ Authlib for Google OAuth integration
- ‚úÖ User model with Google profile data
- ‚úÖ All routes now require authentication
- ‚úÖ Document ownership - each user only sees their own documents

### 2. **New Files Created**

- `templates/login.html` - Beautiful login page with Google sign-in
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- Updated `README.md` - Complete setup instructions

### 3. **Updated Files**

- `app.py` - Added User model, OAuth routes, login protection
- `templates/base.html` - Added user profile display and logout button
- `requirements.txt` - Added Flask-Login, Authlib, python-dotenv

### 4. **Database Changes**

- Added `User` table with google_id, email, name, profile_pic
- Added `user_id` foreign key to `Document` table
- All documents are now associated with users

## Next Steps - IMPORTANT!

### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Console (5-10 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Enable "Google+ API" or "People API"
4. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
5. Configure OAuth consent screen:
   - User Type: External
   - App name: Study Organiser
   - User support email: your email
   - Developer contact: your email
6. Create OAuth Client ID:
   - Application type: Web application
   - Name: Study Organiser
   - Authorized redirect URIs: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login/google/callback`
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Create .env File

1. Copy the example file:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and paste your credentials:

   ```
   SECRET_KEY=<generate a random key>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
   ```

3. Generate a SECRET_KEY:
   ```powershell
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
   ```

### Step 3: Recreate the Database

Since we added new tables, you need to recreate the database:

```powershell
Remove-Item documents.db -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python app.py
```

Press Ctrl+C after the server starts, then run it in background:

```powershell
python app.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Authentication

1. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/
2. You should see the login page
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Authorize the app
5. You'll be redirected to the dashboard
6. Upload a document or create a note
7. Log out and log back in - your documents should still be there!

## Features Now Available

### üîê Secure Authentication

- Users must sign in with Google to access the app
- Each user has their own private document collection
- Users can't see or access other users' documents

### üë§ User Profile

- Profile picture and name displayed in navbar
- Logout button for security
- User info stored from Google account

### üìÅ Multi-User Support

- Multiple users can use the same app
- Documents are isolated per user
- Each user has independent organization

## File Changes Summary

```
Modified:
  - app.py (added authentication, User model, OAuth setup)
  - templates/base.html (navbar with user profile)
  - requirements.txt (added auth packages)
  - README.md (comprehensive documentation)

Created:
  - templates/login.html (login page)
  - .env.example (environment variables template)
  - SETUP_COMPLETE.md (this file)

Database Schema Changes:
  - Added User table
  - Added user_id to Document table
```

## Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER commit your `.env` file to git!**
‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` confidential
‚ö†Ô∏è Use a strong random `SECRET_KEY`

## What's Different?

### Before:

- Anyone could access the app
- All documents were visible to everyone
- No user management

### After:

- Users must sign in with Google
- Each user sees only their own documents
- Secure multi-user environment
- Professional authentication flow

## Troubleshooting

If you see "Redirect URI mismatch" error:

- Check that the URI in Google Console is exactly: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login/google/callback`
- No trailing slash
- Use `127.0.0.1` not `localhost`

If you see "Import dotenv error":

- Run: `pip install python-dotenv`

If login doesn't work:

- Make sure `.env` file exists with correct credentials
- Check that Google+ API is enabled
- Verify redirect URI is correct

## Testing

The existing tests will need updates to work with authentication. For now, test manually:

1. Sign in with Google
2. Upload a document
3. Create a note
4. View by year
5. Preview documents
6. Download documents
7. Log out and log back in
8. Verify your documents are still there
