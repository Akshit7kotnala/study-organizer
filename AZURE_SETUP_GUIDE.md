- **Performance**: **Standard** (cheaper, perfect for documents)
- **Redundancy**: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** (cheapest, good enough)

**Leave other tabs as default** and click "**Review + create**"

## Step 4: Configure Your Application

### 4.1 Open Your .env File

Navigate to your project folder and open `.env`

### 4.2 Update Azure Configuration

Find the Azure section and update:

```env
# Azure Blob Storage Configuration (RECOMMENDED FOR STUDENTS)
# Get these from Azure Portal after creating storage account
# FREE: $100 credit/year with GitHub Student Pack, no credit card needed!
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=studyorgakshi
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_very_long_access_key_here
AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=study-documents

# Storage Configuration
# Set to 'azure' for Azure Blob Storage, 's3' for AWS S3, or 'local' for local filesystem
STORAGE_TYPE=azure
```

### 4.3 Replace Values

- **AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME**: Your storage account name from Step 2.3
- **AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY**: The key1 value from Step 3.2
- **AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME**: `study-documents` (or whatever you named it)
- **STORAGE_TYPE**: Change from `local` to `azure`

## üí° Pro Tips for Students

### Monitor Your Spending

1. In Azure Portal, go to "Cost Management + Billing"
2. Check "Cost analysis" to see credit usage
3. Set up spending alerts (optional)

### Your $100 Lasts a LONG Time!

**Example costs with Azure Blob Storage:**

- Storage: ~$0.018 per GB/month
- $100 = Store **555 GB** for a month, OR
- $100 = Store **50 GB** for **10 months**, OR
- $100 = Store **10 GB** for **55 months** (4.5 years!)

**Reality check**: Most students use 5-20 GB ‚Üí Your credit lasts 1-2 years easily!

### What Happens After Credit Expires?

- You can keep using free services (many services have always-free tiers)
- You can upgrade to pay-as-you-go (with approval)
- You can renew for another year if still a student!

## üîÑ Switching Between Storage Types

Want to test locally first? No problem!

### Use Local Storage:

```env
STORAGE_TYPE=local
```

### Use Azure Cloud Storage:

```env
STORAGE_TYPE=azure
```

### Use AWS S3:

```env
STORAGE_TYPE=s3
```

Just change `STORAGE_TYPE` and restart your app!

**Note**: Existing documents stay where they were uploaded. Only new uploads use the new storage type.

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** to Git (already in .gitignore)
2. **Rotate keys periodically** (Azure lets you regenerate keys)
3. **Use separate containers** for different apps
4. **Enable soft delete** (in container settings - recovers deleted files for 7 days)
5. **Monitor access logs** in Azure Portal

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to initialize Azure Blob Storage"

**Solutions:**

- ‚úì Check storage account name is correct (no typos!)
- ‚úì Verify access key is complete (it's very long, ~88 characters)
- ‚úì Ensure no extra spaces in .env file
- ‚úì Confirm you're using the key1 value, not the connection string

### "Container not found"

**Solutions:**

- ‚úì Check container name matches exactly (case-sensitive!)
- ‚úì Verify container exists in Azure Portal
- ‚úì Make sure you're looking at the right storage account

### "Application falls back to local storage"

**Solutions:**

- ‚úì Check console output for detailed error message
- ‚úì Verify `STORAGE_TYPE=azure` in .env
- ‚úì Restart the application after changing .env

### "Cannot create container"

**Solutions:**

- ‚úì Container may already exist (this is fine!)
- ‚úì Check if you have permissions on the storage account
- ‚úì Ensure storage account is activated

### Files not appearing in Azure Portal

**Solutions:**

- ‚úì Refresh the containers view
- ‚úì Click into `documents/` folder
- ‚úì Check console output for upload errors
- ‚úì Verify STORAGE_TYPE is set to 'azure'
